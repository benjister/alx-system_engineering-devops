**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** Start Time - 15/09/2023 10:45 AM (UTC) / End Time - 15/09/2023 12:30 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The outage impacted the availability of our core service, resulting in a slowdown for 25% of users. Users experienced delays in accessing critical features, impacting their overall experience.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection Time:** 15/09/2023 10:45 AM (UTC)
- **Detection Method:** An automated monitoring alert signaled abnormal response times and elevated error rates.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Initial investigation focused on the database layer, as errors seemed to originate there.
  - Assumed root cause: Increased database load due to recent feature deployment.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Investigated network issues, although monitoring indicated stable network performance.
  - Considered a potential DDoS attack, but traffic patterns were within normal thresholds.
- **Escalation:**
  - Incident escalated to the database and infrastructure teams for a more thorough investigation.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified a poorly optimized database query causing a cascading effect on response times.
  - Implemented an emergency fix by optimizing the query to reduce execution time.
  - Monitored the system for stability and gradually observed a return to normalcy.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - A recently deployed feature inadvertently introduced a complex database query with a high computational cost.
  - The inefficient query strained database resources, leading to increased response times and errors.
- **Resolution:**
  - Immediate fix involved optimizing the problematic database query to enhance performance.
  - Long-term solution: Implemented stricter code review processes to catch performance bottlenecks during development.
  - Conducted a comprehensive performance audit to identify and optimize other potentially problematic queries.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen automated monitoring to detect performance anomalies and errors early.
  - Enhance communication channels between development and operations teams for rapid incident response.
  - Establish clearer deployment guidelines to avoid inadvertently introducing performance bottlenecks.
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of recently deployed features for potential performance impacts.
  - Implement additional automated tests to catch inefficient database queries during the development phase.
  - Enhance documentation to educate developers on best practices for optimizing database queries.
  - Schedule regular performance audits to proactively identify and address potential issues.

**Conclusion:**
This outage highlighted the critical importance of vigilant monitoring and effective communication during incident response. The combination of automated alerts and rapid cross-team collaboration facilitated a quick identification of the root cause and implementation of a timely solution. Moving forward, the outlined corrective and preventative measures aim to fortify our system against similar issues and ensure a more resilient web stack.

By learning from this incident, we strengthen our commitment to delivering a reliable and efficient service to our users while continuously improving our development and operational processes.
